Relics imagines thermoformed plastic packaging as an accidental hieroglyphic language - as it might be interpreted by a future civilisation. Discarded plastic was collected, placed on photographic paper and then exposed to light, revealing the intricacies of the material. Documenting the plastic in this way hints at its fragility - we are shown its fissures and bubbles. However we are also reminded, somewhat paradoxically, of the unsettling permanence of plastic; it will outlive not only the observer but even the photographic print itself. 

The textural quality brought out by the process of making a photogram exposes human intervention on the planet, the traces we have left throughout history in order to leave our mark. This exhibition is intended as a sombre memorial to our present times, and a reverential reflection on our unintended monument of plastic.
