These photograms represent the artistsâ€™ first explorations into cameraless photography. They were made by placing moth specimens into the negative carrier of a 10 x 8 enlarger, essentially turning the moths into photographic negatives.
Transverse orientation is the method by which moths navigate and centre themselves in the world, and in a way, this is also how a photographer operates.
