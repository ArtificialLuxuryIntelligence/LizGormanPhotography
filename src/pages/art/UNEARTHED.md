Bringing together documentary and alternative photography, “Unearthed” is a project made in collaboration with members of the Mudlarking community in London. ‘Mudlarkers’ scour the foreshore of the Thames in search for historic artefacts and treasures, using a keen eye and an extensive knowledge of historical London.

Accompanying Mudlarkers on their expeditions, black and white photographic paper was used to document their finds. The objects were laid on top of the paper, exposed to the sun, stained with Thames mud and washed in river water, producing indexical records of these expeditions into the past.

This body of work plays with the boundaries between documentary photography and abstract image-making. While the close detail of the objects may be obscured, the process in which the prints were made provide a ‘real life’ scale and texture to the images. They are unique prints, the exact conditions in which they were created impossible to reproduce.
