Plastic packaging is designed to safeguard its contents, a protective, almost invisible skin. Our interaction with this object is minimal, a layer to shed in order to obtain the treasure within. The irony is the durability of this material means that even though it is thrown away in an instant, it will long outlive the item it was created to preserve. As the item perishes or is consumed, we are left with this relic as evidence of a moment.
In this way, there is a parallel with photography; the photographic image acts as a document to a moment, a trace of what has gone, and with that a reminder of the end of things. The artistâ€™s face has been cast in clear plastic, placed upon photographic paper and exposed to light creating a cameraless photographic death mask. This is an attempt at confronting inexorable non-existence and the human desire to surpass it through artistic endeavours.
