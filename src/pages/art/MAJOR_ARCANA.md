The design of the cards is monochromatic and minimalist; each card is essentially a photographic negative. They are made by placing an object directly on top of the photographic paper and exposing the paper to light.

The objects selected for these cards represent the artist’s interpretations of the imagery in the Rider-Waite deck, as well as drawing inspiration from the history of photography. The objects are made up of scientific equipment and personal effects. The deck draws a parallel between the origins of photography and the rise in popularity in Spiritualism; in both cases there was an ambiguity between science and mysticism; real and illusion.

This equivocality between the notion of what is real and what is fantasy rings true throughout all applications of photography and in today’s feverish obsession with ‘fake news’.
